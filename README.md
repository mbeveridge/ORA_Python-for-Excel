## Part I. Introduction to Python

### 01. Why Python for Excel
* P.10 : "[xltrail](https://xltrail.com), a Git-based version control system that knows how to deal with Excel files"
* P.11 : "Excel community uses _modern Excel_ to refer to the tools that were added with Excel 2010: most importantly Power Query and Power Pivot"
* P.11 : "Power Query is only partially available on macOS - however, it is being actively developed, so it should be fully supported in a future release of Excel"
* P.11 "Power Pivot ... remains an add-in and is so far not available on macOS"
* P.12 "Power BI ... [has] been supporting Python scripts since 2018. ... Accordingly, the hopes are high that one day Python will find an official way into Excel, too"
